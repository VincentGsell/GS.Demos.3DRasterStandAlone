# GS.Demos.3DRasterStandAlone
3D raster exemple, all in one unit, learning aims ![Alt text](/gitimg/ZBufferDisplay.png?raw=true "ZBuffer")

# Goal : 
In order to understand well, how, basicaly, work a 3d raster process from scratch, I made this little demo, and want to make keep it very simple for learning purpose. (so, no optimization, no "hype" class stack and so on ;)
It groups many stuffs read on great ScratchPixel site (https://www.scratchapixel.com) and a few other sources.
You have all the step in one unit, from 3d calculus to raster process. All 3d Pipeline is virtualy present
 
# Roadmap : 
- ZBuffer display [done]
- [TODO] Texture .
- [TODO]Lazarus version.

# Dependancy

For Pure raster drawing, the demo use GS.Pixel32, which is a brand new, simple 32 bits raster tools : 

- [GS.Pixel32 is part of GS.Core](https://github.com/VincentGsell/GS.Core)
